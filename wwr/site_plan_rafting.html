      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        I am doing my senior project using JavaScript so this is my website
        idea. The purpose of the project is to create a simple but useful
        scheduling website so the CIT department can use it to schedule classes
        for each semester. The website is going to be able to save time for the
        secretaries and department chair.
      </p>
      <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        The users are going to be secretaries and department chairs in the CIT
        department. If it is successful then other departments on campus can use
        the website as well.
      </p>

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

      <h2>Style Guide</h2>

      <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

      <h3>Color Palette</h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
      <p>Palette URL:</p>
      <a
        href="https://coolors.co/173753-6daedb-2892d7-1b4353-1d70a2"
        target="_blank"
        >https://coolors.co/173753-6daedb-2892d7-1b4353-1d70a2</a
      >

      <table class="colors">
        <tr>
          <th>Primary</th>
          <th>Secondary</th>
          <th>Accent 1</th>
          <th>Accent 2</th>
        </tr>
        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
        <tr>
          <td class="primary">[#1D70A2]</td>
          <td class="secondary">[#2892D7]</td>
          <td class="accent1">[#6DAEDB]</td>
          <td class="accent2"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <!-- ------------------------Steps 10-12------------------------------ -->

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Serif fonts
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Display fonts
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
      <p>
        I will be just doing the front-end. I will use JavaScript and I will try
        to incorporate React as well. The schedule will have different pages.
        For example, it will show Monday, Wednesday, and Friday schedules on one
        page, and on the other page, it will show Tuesday and Thursday
        schedules. It will say which semester the schedule is so for example it
        will show Winter 2022, Spring 2022, Fall 2022 â€¦ in a dropdown menu. Each
        professor will have a different color. Also, you can edit each class and
        it will move to the right spot. It will show the class time on the left
        side of the screen. The picture below is my inspiration. If I have extra
        time, I will change the color palette to match all the school's
        websites.
      </p>
      <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
      <p class="colored">
        I want to help the school that has given me a great education. Even
        though creating this website is not going to have great a big impact; I
        can still help departments. I want to help those secretaries which whom
        I have a great relationship. I feel this website can save time for those
        staff that is busy.
      </p>

      <h3>Navigation</h3>
      <!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->
